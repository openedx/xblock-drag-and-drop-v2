Version 3.2.1 (2023-10-12)
---------------------------

* Added support for Django 4.2
* The command `make extract_translations` now uses `msgcat` instead of `tail` to combine `djangojs-partial.po` into `django.po`. This is to avoid the possibility of having message compilation failure because of duplicate strings (strings shared between both files)

  BREAKING CHANGE: This version is no longer compatible with Maple.

--------------------------

* Prepare repository for upcoming changes related to [openedx-translations](https://github.com/openedx/openedx-translations).
  * `conf/locale` directory is now the source of truth for translations.
  * `translations` directory is now a symbolic link for backwards compatibility.
  * `locale` symbolic link is deleted to avoid too many symbolic links.
  * `en` translations are now extracted into `django.po` instead of `text.po`.
  * `en` `text.po` is now a symbolic link to `django.po` for backwards compatibility.

---------------------------

* Add item option to remove padding from images dropped on a zone.

* Hides text when a draggable item is placed in a target zone and frontend wait for LMS response, this is done since the size of the item increases when the spinner is visible.
